# Filemaid

Rule-based file- and folder-organization tool inspired by
[Belvedere](https://lifehacker.com/341950/belvedere-automates-your-self-cleaning-pc)
and similar programs such as [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) and
[DropIt](http://www.dropitproject.com/).

*Be careful, this is a mostly untested script -- don't run it on
important folders and files.*

It is recommended to take a look at the source code (a single file) for
now to get a better grasp on Filemaid's capabilities.


## Configuration
Configuration is done through YAML files. Some configurations to get you
started can be found in the examples folder.
